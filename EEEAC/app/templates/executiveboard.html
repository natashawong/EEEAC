          <h1>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</h1>
          <hr>
  </div>
  <h3 class="headerOther">
      "The EC is a standing committee whose composition reflects a broad range of research areas within the field of environmental economics."
  </h3>
  <p>
      These areas may include: air, benefit cost analysis, climate change, energy, enforcement and compliance, health, waste, water, valuation.
      <br><br>
      The purpose of the EC is to identify proposed rules, other regulatory changes, and EPA
      products (e.g., guidelines, methodologies, documents) for review by the EEAC. The EC also
      identifies Review Committee chair or chairs who will be charged with populating the RCs.
      Where appropriate, a member of the EC may serve in this capacity or as a member of a RC.
      Any EC member can make a motion to initiate an RC review and/or to appoint RC chair(s).
      The EC also facilitates dissemination of RC reviews and coordinates communications with
      EPA staff, other federal agency staff as well as with affiliated groups as necessary.
      <br><br>
      Each member of the EC serves 3-year term of service. The EC convenes via phone, video, or
      in person at least quarterly. The EC nominates a chair or co-chairs who are responsible for
      convening quarterly meetings. EC chair(s) serve in that capacity for one year with the
      possibility of renewal for a second year.

        Dallas Burtraw
      </h6>
      <p>
        Dallas Burtraw has worked to promote efficient control of air pollution and written extensively on electricity industry regulation and environmental outcomes. Burtraw’s current research includes analysis of the distributional and regional consequences of climate policy, the evolution of electricity markets including renewable integration, and the interaction of climate policy with electricity markets. He has provided technical support in the design of carbon dioxide emissions trading programs in the Northeast states, California, and the European Union. He also has studied regulation of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide under the Clean Air Act and conducted integrated assessment of costs, and modeled health and ecosystem effects and valuation, including ecosystem improvement in the Adirondack Park and the southern Appalachian region. Burtraw has served on EPA’s Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (1998-2004), Advisory Council on Clean Air Act Compliance (2004-2011), National Academy of Sciences Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology (2005-2011), the National Research Council Committee on Air Quality Management (2001-2004) and several others.

She also explores issues related to the enforcement of and compliance with environmental regulations. Her research has been published in the Review of Economics and Statistics, the Journal of Public Economics, the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, among other journals. She received the 2016 Ralph C. d'Arge and Allen V. Kneese Award for Outstanding Publication in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists for her paper "The Clean Air Act Watch List: An Enforcement and Compliance Natural Experiment."

She is an Associate Professor in the Agriculture and Resource Economics department and a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research. Fowlie's research is energy-oriented and policy driven. She has investigated how market-based environmental regulations are working in practice, the economics of renewable energy, demand-side energy efficiency, and policies designed to expand energy access in emerging economies.  Much of her work integrates methods and models from other disciplines into the economic analysis of policy outcomes. Her research has been published in top economics journals including The American Economic Review, The Journal of Political Economy, The Review of Economics and Statistics, and the Quarterly Journal of Economics. Fowlie has served in an advisory capacity to state and federal governments. She was recently appointed by the Governor of California to serve on an Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee (IEAC) which is tasked with performing an annual review of California's cap-and-trade program and other environmental laws.

          F. Reed Johnson, PhD
        </h6>
        <p>
          Dr. Johnson has more than 40 years of academic and research experience in health and environmental economics. He has served on the faculties of universities in the United States, Canada, and Sweden, as Distinguished Fellow at Research Triangle Institute, and currently as Professor in the Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke School of Medicine, as well as appointments in the Center for Health Measurement and the Duke Clinical Research Institute. As a staff member in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental economics research program during the 1980s, Dr. Johnson helped pioneer development of nonmarket-valuation techniques. These methods are now widely used in federally mandated regulatory-impact studies, for estimating the value of improved health outcomes, and for quantifying patients’ tolerance for treatment-related risks. Dr. Johnson has over 140 publications in books and peer-reviewed journals. His research has been published in medical, health-economics, environmental-economics, and general-economics journals. He has coauthored a book on techniques for using existing environmental and health value estimates for policy analysis. His current research involves quantifying patients’ willingness to accept side­effect risks in return for therapeutic benefits and estimating general time equivalences among health states. In 2018 the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research awarded him the Donabedian Outcomes Research Lifetime Achievement Award.  He is a founding member of the International Academy of Health Preference Research.  He currently serves on the editorial board for The Patient and the ISPOR Health Science Policy Council.  He served on EPA’s Environmental Economics Advisory Committee 2002-2007, 2009-2010, and 2013-2018.
